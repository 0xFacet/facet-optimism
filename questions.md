# Questions for CodeRabbit:

Hey @coderabbitio, I have some questions about what you can do, a PR seemed like a good enough way
to go about it. Maybe you can add a comment in response to each of these items?


1. Can you read a Style Guide that's in this repo and use it during review? For example, can you
   what does the our [Solidity Guide](./packages/contracts-bedrock/STYLE_GUIDE.md) say about this
   function declaration?

   ```
   function foo(uint x) public returns (uint _y);
   ```

2. Can we make special requests in a PR review, ie. for you to leave suggestions as inline comments?


3. Are you able to adapt to our feedback overtime? How does that work?
